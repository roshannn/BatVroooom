This is a fresh new take on cricket. Since no one has thought of it before. Cricket on Bikes.

Core loop is exactly like cricket. Each over has 6 balls. Batsman hits a shot scores runs, but the fresh take here is that, the bat is attached at the front of the bike. 
Player has a button they use to rev up their bike. How much they've revved decides how high the bike will wheelie to hit the incoming delivery of ball.
